	abstract = {Researches on advanced tokamak (AT) have progressed with integrated modeling in JT-60 Upgrade [N. Oyama, Nucl. Fusion 49, 104007 (2009)]. Based on JT-60U experimental analyses and first principle simulations, new models were developed and integrated into core, rotation, edge/pedestal, and scrape-off-layer (SOL)/divertor codes. The integrated models clarified complex and autonomous features in AT. An integrated core model was implemented to take account of an anomalous radial transport of alpha particles caused by Alfven eigenmodes. It showed the reduction in the fusion gain by the anomalous radial transport and further escape of alpha particles. Integrated rotation model showed mechanisms of rotation driven by the magnetic-field-ripple loss of fast ions and the charge separation due to fast-ion drift. An inward pinch model of high-Z impurity due to the atomic process was developed and indicated that the pinch velocity increases with the toroidal rotation. Integrated edge/pedestal model clarified causes of collisionality dependence of energy loss due to the edge localized mode and the enhancement of energy loss by steepening a core pressure gradient just inside the pedestal top. An ideal magnetohydrodynamics stability code was developed to take account of toroidal rotation and clarified a destabilizing effect of rotation on the pedestal. Integrated SOL/divertor model clarified a mechanism of X-point multifaceted asymmetric radiation from edge. A model of the SOL flow driven by core particle orbits which partially enter the SOL was developed by introducing the ion-orbit-induced flow to fluid equations. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {As computing capabilities have increased, the coupling of computational models has become an increasingly viable and therefore important way of improving the physical fidelity of simulations. Applications currently using some form of multicode or multi-component coupling include climate modeling, rocket simulations, and chemistry. In recent years, the plasma physics community has also begun to pursue integrated multi-physics simulations for space weather and fusion energy applications. Such model coupling generally exposes new issues in the physical, mathematical, and computational aspects of the problem. This paper focuses on the computational aspects of one such effort, detailing the design, and implementation of the Integrated Plasma Simulator (IPS) for the Center for Simulation of Wave Interactions with Magnetohydrodynamics (SWIM). The IPS framework focuses on maximizing flexibility for the creators of loosely-coupled component-based simulations, and provides services for execution coordination, resource management, data management, and inter-component communication. It also serves as a proving ground for a concurrent "multi-tasking" execution model to improve resource utilization, and application-level fault tolerance. We also briefly describe how the IPS has been applied to several problems of interest to the fusion community. © 2010 IEEE.},

It solves simultaneously a set of flux-surface averaged equations composed of Maxwell's equations, continuity equations, equations of motion, heat transport equations, fast-particle slowing-down equations and two-group neutral diffusion equations. The set of equations describes plasma rotations in both toroidal and poloidal directions through momentum transfer and evaluates the radial electric field self-consistently. The finite element method with a piecewise linear interpolation function is employed with a fine radial mesh near the plasma surface. The Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin method is also used for robust calculation. We have confirmed that the neoclassical properties are well described by the poloidal neoclassical viscous force.

In this paper we describe the development of two neural-network (NN) based models as a means to perform a snon-linear multivariate regression of theory-based models for the core turbulent transport fluxes, and the pedestal structure. Specifically, we find that a NN-based approach can be used to consistently reproduce the results of the TGLF and EPED1 theory-based models over a broad range of plasma regimes, and with a computational speedup of several orders of magnitudes. These models are then integrated into a predictive workflow that allows prediction with self-consistent core-pedestal coupling of the kinetic profiles within the last closed flux surface of the plasma. The NN paradigm is capable of breaking the speed-accuracy trade-off that is expected of traditional numerical physics models, and can provide the missing link towards self-consistent coupled core-pedestal whole device modeling simulations that are physically accurate and yet take only seconds to run.},

	abstract = {The dissipation induced by coulomb-collisional scattering provides an irreducible minimum, and thus a useful standard for comparison, for transport processes in a hot, magnetically confined plasma. The kinetic description of this dissipation is provided by an equation of the Fokker-Planck form. As in the standard transport theory for a neutral gas, approximate solution of the Fokker-Planck equation permits the calculation of transport coefficients, which linearly relate the fluxes of particles, energy, and electric charge, to the density and temperature gradients, and to the electric field. The transport relations are useful in studying the confinement properties of present and future experimental devices for research in controlled thermonuclear fusion. The transport theory for a magnetized plasma (in which the Larmor radius is much smaller than gradient scale lengths describing the plasma fluid) departs from the theory for a neutral gas in several fundamental ways. Thus, transport coefficients for a magnetized plasma can be calculated even when the collisional mean free path is much longer than the gradient scale length (as would pertain in thermonuclear regimes). Such transport coefficients are generally nonlocal, being defined in terms of averages over surfaces with macroscopic dimensions. Furthermore, when the mean free path is long, the magnetized-plasma transport coefficients depend crucially upon the magnetic field geometry, the effects of which must be treated at the kinetic level of the Fokker-Planck equation. The results display several novel couplings between collisional dissipation and the electromagnetic field. The present review of magnetized-plasma transport theory is intended to be as widely accessible as possible. Thus the relevant features of magnetic confinement in closed (toroidal) systems, and of charged particles in spatially varying fields, are derived, at least in outline, from first principles. Although consideration is given to "classical" transport in which most field geometric effects are omitted, major emphasis is placed on the "neoclassical" theory which has been developed over the last decade. Neoclassical transport coefficients are specifically relevant to a magnetically confined plasma, rather than to just a magnetized plasma; their unusual features, such as nonlocality and geometry dependence, become particularly important in the high temperature regime of proposed thermonuclear reactors. The area of neoclassical theory which seems most complete-its application to axisymmetric tokamak-type confinement systems-is correspondingly stressed. © 1976 American Physical Society.},

Taking experimental data from the ITPA profile database, simulations have been carried out to compare the results with each other using our one-dimensional diffusive transport code. It is found that each model has unique dependence on devices and operation modes, and most reasonable results among the models can be obtained by the CDBM model for L-mode discharges and by the GLF23 model for H-modes. From an analysis of Te/Ti dependence, predictions of the CDBM and Weiland models could be better in the hot electron regime. The effect of the elliptic cross section of the plasma has been included in the CDBM model, and it is confirmed that an accuracy of the prediction is improved for H-mode discharges.

The avoidance of large-scale plasma instabilities called disruptions within these reactors 2,3 is one of the most pressing challenges 4,5 , because disruptions can halt power production and damage key components. Disruptions are particularly harmful for large burning-plasma systems such as the multibillion-dollar International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project 6 currently under construction, which aims to be the first reactor that produces more power from fusion than is injected to heat the plasma. Here we present a method based on deep learning for forecasting disruptions. Our method extends considerably the capabilities of previous strategies such as first-principles-based 5 and classical machine-learning 7–11 approaches. In particular, it delivers reliable predictions for machines other than the one on which it was trained—a crucial requirement for future large reactors that cannot afford training disruptions. Our approach takes advantage of high-dimensional training data to boost predictive performance while also engaging supercomputing resources at the largest scale to improve accuracy and speed. Trained on experimental data from the largest tokamaks in the United States (DIII-D 12 ) and the world (Joint European Torus, JET 13 ), our method can also be applied to specific tasks such as prediction with long warning times: this opens up the possibility of moving from passive disruption prediction to active reactor control and optimization. These initial results illustrate the potential for deep learning to accelerate progress in fusion-energy science and, more generally, in the understanding and prediction of complex physical systems.},

Auxiliary heating by negative ion neutral beam injection and ion-cyclotron heating of He3 minority ions are modelled, and the GLF23 transport model is used in the prediction of the evolution of plasma temperature profiles. Effects of beam steering, beam torque, plasma rotation, beam current drive, pedestal temperatures, sawtooth oscillations, magnetic diffusion and accumulation of He ash are treated self-consistently. Variations in assumptions associated with physics uncertainties for standard base-line DT H-mode plasmas (with Ip = 15 MA, BTF = 5.3 T and Greenwald fraction = 0.86) lead to a range of predictions for DT fusion power PDT and quasi-steady state fusion QDT (≡PDT/Paux). Typical predictions assuming Paux = 50-53 MW yield PDT = 250-720 MW and Q DT = 5-14. In some cases where Paux is ramped down or shut off after initial flat-top conditions, quasi-steady QDT can be considerably higher, even infinite. Adverse physics assumptions such as the existence of an inward pinch of the helium ash and an ash recycling coefficient approaching unity lead to very low values for PDT. Alternative scenarios with different heating and reduced performance regimes are also considered including plasmas with only H or D isotopes, DT plasmas with toroidal field reduced 10\% or 20\% and discharges with reduced beam voltage. In full-performance D-only discharges, tritium burn up is predicted to generate central tritium densities up to 1016 m-3 and DT neutron rates up to 5 × 1016 s-1, compared with the DD neutron rates of 6 × 1017 s-1. Predictions with the toroidal field reduced 10\% or 20\% below the planned 5.3 T and keeping the same q98, Greenwald fraction and βn indicate that the fusion yield PDT and QDT will be lower by about a factor of two (scaling as B3.5). © 2008 IAEA, Vienna.},

The framework developed by the ITM-TF, based on a generic data structure including both simulated and experimental data, allows for the development of sophisticated integrated simulations (workflows) for physics application. The equilibrium reconstruction and linear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability simulation chain was applied, in particular, to the analysis of the edge MHD stability of ASDEX Upgrade type-I ELMy H-mode discharges and ITER hybrid scenario, demonstrating the stabilizing effect of an increased Shafranov shift on edge modes. Interpretive simulations of a JET hybrid discharge were performed with two electromagnetic turbulence codes within ITM infrastructure showing the signature of trapped-electron assisted ITG turbulence. A successful benchmark among five EC beam/ray-tracing codes was performed in the ITM framework for an ITER inductive scenario for different launching conditions from the equatorial and upper launcher, showing good agreement of the computed absorbed power and driven current. Selected achievements and scientific workflow applications targeting key modelling topics and physics problems are also presented, showing the current status of the ITM-TF modelling suite. © 2014 EURATOM.},

Fusion, 44, 452 (2004)] is targeting long pulse high performance, noninductive sustained operations at low aspect ratio, and the demonstration of nonsolenoidal startup and current rampup. The modeling of these plasmas provides a framework for experimental planning and identifies the tools to access these regimes. Simulations based on neutral beam injection (NBI)-heated plasmas are made to understand the impact of various modifications and identify the requirements for (1) high elongation and triangularity, (2) density control to optimize the current drive, (3) plasma rotation and/or feedback stabilization to operate above the no-wall Β limit, and (4) electron Bernstein waves (EBW) for off-axis heating/current drive (H/CD). Integrated scenarios are constructed to provide the transport evolution and H/CD source modeling, supported by rf and stability analyses. Important factors include the energy confinement, Zeff, early heating/H mode, broadening of the NBI-driven current profile, and maintaining q(0) and qmin {\textbackslash}textgreater1.0. Simulations show that noninductive sustained plasmas can be reached at IP =800 kA, BT =0.5 T, κ≈2.5, ΒN ≤5, Β≤15\%, fNI =92\%, and q(0){\textbackslash}textgreater1.0 with NBI H/CD, density control, and similar global energy confinement to experiments.

A scenario for nonsolenoidal plasma current rampup is developed using high harmonic fast wave H/CD in the early low IP and low Te phase, followed by NBI H/CD to continue the current ramp, reaching a maximum of 480 kA after 3.4 s. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {One modeling framework for integrated tasks (OMFIT) is a comprehensive integrated modeling framework which has been developed to enable physics codes to interact in complicated workflows, and support scientists at all stages of the modeling cycle. The OMFIT development follows a unique bottom-up approach, where the framework design and capabilities organically evolve to support progressive integration of the components that are required to accomplish physics goals of increasing complexity. OMFIT provides a workflow for easily generating full kinetic equilibrium reconstructions that are constrained by magnetic and motional Stark effect measurements, and kinetic profile information that includes fast-ion pressure modeled by a transport code. It was found that magnetic measurements can be used to quantify the amount of anomalous fast-ion diffusion that is present in DIII-D discharges, and provide an estimate that is consistent with what would be needed for transport simulations to match the measured neutron rates. OMFIT was used to streamline edge-stability analyses, and evaluate the effect of resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) on the pedestal stability, which have been found to be consistent with the experimental observations. The development of a five-dimensional numerical fluid model for estimating the effects of the interaction between magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and microturbulence, and its systematic verification against analytic models was also supported by the framework. OMFIT was used for optimizing an innovative high-harmonic fast wave system proposed for DIII-D. For a parallel refractive index n{\textbar}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}textgreater3, the conditions for strong electron-Landau damping were found to be independent of launched n{\textbar}{\textbar} and poloidal angle. OMFIT has been the platform of choice for developing a neural-network based approach to efficiently perform a non-linear multivariate regression of local transport fluxes as a function of local dimensionless parameters. Transport predictions for thousands of DIII-D discharges showed excellent agreement with the power balance calculations across the whole plasma radius and over a broad range of operating regimes. Concerning predictive transport simulations, the framework made possible the design and automation of a workflow that enables self-consistent predictions of kinetic profiles and the plasma equilibrium. It is found that the feedback between the transport fluxes and plasma equilibrium can significantly affect the kinetic profiles predictions. Such a rich set of results provide tangible evidence of how bottom-up approaches can potentially provide a fast track to integrated modeling solutions that are functional, cost-effective, and in sync with the research effort of the community.},

	abstract = {An integrated simulation code TOPICS-IB based on a transport code with a stability code for the peeling-ballooning modes and a scrape-off-layer (SOL) model has been developed to clarify self-consistent effects of edge localized modes (ELMs) and the SOL on the plasma performance. Experimentally observed collisionality dependence of the ELM energy loss is found to be caused by both the edge bootstrap current and the SOL transport. The bootstrap current decreases with an increase in collisionality and intensifies the magnetic shear at the pedestal region. The increase in the magnetic shear reduces the width of eigenfunctions of unstable modes, which results in the reduction of both the area of the ELM enhanced transport and the ELM enhanced transport near the separatrix. On the other hand, when an ELM crash occurs, the energy flows into the SOL and the SOL temperature rapidly increases. The increase in the SOL temperature lowers the ELM energy loss due to the flattening of the radial edge gradient. The parallel electron heat conduction determines how the SOL temperature increases. For higher collisionality, the conduction becomes lower and the SOL electron temperature increases more. By the above two mechanisms, the ELM energy loss decreases with increasing collisionality. © 2007 IAEA, Vienna.},

Due to the huge electromagnetic loading and thermal loading on the facility and a large number of runaway electrons generated during disruptions, it is essential to find a method to predict the disruptions, so that measures like massive gas injection can be taken to mitigate or to avoid these harmful effects. In this research, a machine learning model mainly based on a 1.5-dimensional convolutional neural network, which is good at dealing with signals from multi-channels with great divergence, is trained to predict disruptions in the HL-2A tokamak. The disruption predictor uses shots 20000–29999 in HL-2A to train the machine learning model, and uses shots 30000–31999 to optimize hyper parameters. When tested on shots 32000–36000 in HL-2A, it reaches a true positive rate of 92.2\% and a true negative rate of 97.5\% with 30 ms before the disruption.},

	abstract = {Systems do not simply pop into existence. They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with NASA’s current work with the Digital Twin.},

	abstract = {This book is devoted to mathematical modeling of tokamak plasma. Since the appearance in 1982 of the first edition (in Russian), a considerable amount of experimental and theoretical material on tokamak research has been accumu lated. The new-generation devices, viz. , TFTR, JET and JT-60 were put into operation. The first experiments on these units have confirmed the correctness of the basic physical concepts underlying their construction. Experiments on plasma heating with the help of neutral beams and high-frequency (HF) waves on previous generation devices made it possible to obtain high-P plasmas. The number of "medium-size" tokamaks in operation has increased. New experi mental results and advances in the theory have led to more complicated and perfected models of high-temperature plasma. Rapid progress in computer hardware and software has played an important role in the further development of mathematical modeling. While preparing the English edition of the book, we have revised the text considerably. Several new models which have undergone significant advance ment in recent years are described. A section devoted to models of RF (radio frequency) current drive has been added to Chap. 2. The reduced magneto hydrodynamic (MHD) equations for high-P plasma are now considered in detail in Chap. 3. Chapter 4 contains the latest results on anomalous thermal conductivity, diffusion coefficient and pinching. Two new sections are added to Chap. 5.},

development of integrated modeling of multi-scale physics, and
implementation of distributed parallel processing. Similar activities have been reported in the United States and the European Union. Features of the integrated transport code, TASK, being developed as a reference code for BPSI, are also described. Finally, asummary is given and future issues are discussed.},
