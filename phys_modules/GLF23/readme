The

GLF23_source_module.f

includes all of the orginal source files. The actual glf23 source files 
are maintained as obtained with the exception that all end
statements have been changed to end subroutine and function 
to be consistent with f90 conventions.

Some particular problems while including tha zgeev and blas_zgeev.f routine
these are obvously taken out of the lapack and blas library packages and 
have a lot of external statements. WHile moving these internal to a module 
they are forced into the same scope and declarations and external statements 
forces compiler errors. ALL of the declaration and relevant external 
statements have been removed from both of these to routines.

If optimized pre-compiled libraries are needed/used with the package then 
GLF23_source_module.f need to be slightly modified to NOT include 
blas_zgeev.f and zgeev.f files.
