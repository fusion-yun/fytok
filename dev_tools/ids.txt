core_transport                 :: Core plasma transport of particles, energy, momentum and poloidal flux. The transport of particles, energy and momentum is described by diffusion coefficients, D, and convection velocities, v. These are defined by the total fluxes of particles, energy and momentum, across a flux surface given by : V' [-D Y' <|grad(rho_tor_norm)|^2gt; + v Y <|grad(rho_tor_norm)|>], where Y represents the particles, energy and momentum density, respectively, while V is the volume inside a flux surface, the primes denote derivatives with respect to rho_tor_norm and < X > is the flux surface average of a quantity X. This formulation remains valid when changing simultaneously rho_tor_norm into rho_tor in the gradient terms and in the derivatives denoted by the prime. The average flux stored in the IDS as sibling of D and v is the total flux described above divided by the flux surface area V' <|grad(rho_tor_norm)|>. Note that the energy flux includes the energy transported by the particle flux.    1
