coils_non_axisymmetric         :: Non axisymmetric active coils system (e.g. ELM control coils, error field correction coils, ...) 
em_coupling                    :: Description of the axisymmetric mutual electromagnetics; does not include non-axisymmetric coil systems; the convention is Quantity_Sensor_Source  
iron_core                      :: Iron core description  
gas_injection                  :: Gas injection by a system of pipes and valves  
ec_launchers                   :: Launchers for heating and current drive in the electron cyclotron (EC) frequencies.  
ic_antennas                    :: Antenna systems for heating and current drive in the ion cylcotron (IC) frequencies.  
lh_antennas                    :: Antenna systems for heating and current drive in the Lower Hybrid (LH) frequencies. In the definitions below, the front (or mouth) of the antenna refers to the plasma facing side of the antenna, while the back refers to the waveguides connected side of the antenna (towards the RF generators).  
nbi                            :: Neutral Beam Injection systems and description of the fast neutrals that arrive into the torus

pulse_schedule                 :: Description of Pulse Schedule, described by subsystems waveform references and an enveloppe around them. The controllers, pulse schedule and SDN are defined in separate IDSs. All names and identifiers of subsystems appearing in the pulse_schedule must be identical to those used in the IDSs describing the related subsystems.  
sdn                            :: Description of the Synchronous Data Network parameters and the signals on it  
controllers                    :: Feedback and feedforward controllers
