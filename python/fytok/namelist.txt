amns_data                      :: Atomic, molecular, nuclear and surface physics data. Each occurrence contains the data for a given element (nuclear charge), describing various physical processes. For each process, data tables are organized by charge states. The coordinate system used by the data tables is described under the coordinate_system node.  
sawteeth                       :: Description of sawtooth events. This IDS must be used in homogeneous_time = 1 mode  
core_instant_changes           :: Instant changes of the radial core plasma profiles due to pellet, MHD, ...  
disruption                     :: Description of physics quantities of specific interest during a disruption, in particular halo currents, etc ...  
distribution_sources           :: Sources of particles for input to kinetic equations, e.g. Fokker-Planck calculation. The sources could originate from e.g. NBI or fusion reactions.    4
distributions                  :: Distribution function(s) of one or many particle species. This structure is specifically designed to handle non-Maxwellian distribution function generated during heating and current drive, typically solved using a Fokker-Planck calculation perturbed by a heating scheme (e.g. IC, EC, LH, NBI, or alpha heating) and then relaxed by Coloumb collisions.    8
gyrokinetics                   :: Description of a gyrokinetic simulation (delta-f, flux-tube). All quantities within this IDS are normalised (apart from time), thus independent of rhostar, consistently with the local approximation and a spectral representation is assumed in the perpendicular plane (i.e. homogeneous turbulence). All quantities are given in the laboratory frame, except the moments of the perturbed distribution function which are given in the rotating frame.  
mhd                            :: Magnetohydrodynamic activity, description of perturbed fields and profiles using the Generic Grid Description.  
mhd_linear                     :: Magnetohydronamic linear stability 
ntms                           :: Description of neoclassical tearing modes  
radiation                      :: Radiation emitted by the plasma and neutrals  
turbulence                     :: Description of plasma turbulence  
waves                          :: RF wave propagation and deposition. Note that current estimates in this IDS are a priori not taking into account synergies between multiple sources (a convergence loop with Fokker-Planck calculations is required to account for such synergies)
